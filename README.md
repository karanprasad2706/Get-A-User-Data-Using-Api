During my LGMVIP Web Developer Internship, I successfully implemented Beginner Level - Task 2. Using React, I crafted a Navbar featuring a brand name and a 'Get Users' button. Clicking the button triggered an API call, enabling the display of fetched user data within the app interface.

Here are Explained Features:
1. First You will see a Navbar containing Brand Name and "Get Users" Button.
2. User Clicks On "Get Users" Button Which Calls an Api to Get A User Data.
3. After Clicking It Loads The Data and it also shows a "Loading..." loader while fetching Data. And shows the data.
4. I used CSS for styling the components.
